## Assumptions
1. The insurance company only offers annuities to individuals between 40 and 110 years old.
2. No payments will be made to annuitants over 110 years old.


## Types of Plans
There are seven types of plans offered by the insurance company:
1. Annuitant decides which age the payments start and end at; $X per year.
2. Annuitant decides which age the payments start and end at. $X is paid every second year, with the first payment occuring in the first year.
3. Annuitant decides which age the payments start and end at. The first half of the payments are $X each, whereas the second half of the payments are $Y each.
4. Annuitant decides which age the payments start and end at. The annuitant receives a total of $X in payments, and equal payments are made each year.
5. Annuitant decides which age the payments start, and they go to age 110; $X per year.
6. Payments start at age 65 and go to age 94; initial payment is $X and payments increase by $Y each year.
7. Payments start at age 60 and go to age 100. Each year, the annuitant gets $X per year theyâ€™ve been alive. For example, at age 64 the annuitant would receive $64X.
